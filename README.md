# baby-or-not
This is a simple Jupyter Notebook from my Fast.ai studying where the deep learning model will determine if the uploaded picture is a human baby or a baby doll.

This was done in Kaggle, so, ignore the first few lines of code as I simply downloaded and uploaded the .ipynb file.

Libraries needed: numpy, pandas, duckduck_go (for the image search engine), fascore.all (Fast.ai libraries), fastdownload, fastai.vision.

Obs.: Jupyter notebook is in Brazilian Portuguese as I did it for my kids to understand.
